# Notion Smart Emoji Selection

This is a demo of a feature I desperately want Notion to incorporate to their application. When I create a new page, type a title, and click "Add Emoji" the app currently picks an emoji at random. Why not replace that with a smart emoji selection based on the title text that was just entered?

## How it Works

This demo is built using Next.js, using the Transormers.js library from Hugging Face to perform client-side inference. When a user clicks the "Add Emoji" button, the current page title is transformed into an embedding and comapred against a pre-computed vector database of emojis (stored in Vercel's Postgres database with pgvector to enable vector search). The emoji embeddings are computed using a dataset of LLM-generated descriptions and tags. Cosine similarity is used to return the most similar emoji to the title text, and that emoji is displayed as the page icon.
